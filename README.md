# Netiquette2020
Network Etiquette (Netiquette) -- Written with 2020 technology in mind

This document is a work-in-progress draft outlining a minimum set of guidelines for Network Etiquette (Netiquette) which organizations, individuals, and administrators may take and adapt for their own use.  As such, it is written in a bulleted format to make adaptation easier and to make any particular item easy to find.

It is inspired by the original, 1995 Netiquette document (originally published by Sally Hambridge), but written from scratch with a focus on technology, network, and social needs of the year 2020.

The original 1995 Netiquette, for reference, can be found at the following location:
